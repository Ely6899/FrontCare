## Description
Today, and from time to time, the State of Israel is in a state of emergency, in which there is a need for mass fundraising. There are many gaps between regular and reserve soldiers who serve in different places in the country and need equipment that they do not have, such as warm clothing, portable chargers and even in extreme cases ceramic vests, and donors who are looking to donate the necessary equipment to them.

Currently, there are all kinds of donation centers that are opened independently and unorganized from the other donation centers. It is necessary to link in an organized manner between all the soldiers who need donations and all the donors and fundraisers. This is exactly where our app comes in.

The FrontCare application solves those problems, connects soldiers with donors, allows soldiers to post donation requests, and organizes fundraising events. In doing so, the FrontCare application organizes and organizes the fundraising process for soldiers.
